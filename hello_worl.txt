"hello my friend Odin and git"
this is the practice time. my first practice of how to work with the git repository, like to clone then add to stage sate with git add <filename>, and then set it to the commit state with git commit <fileName>. then open it on code editor, eith code .  and then make some changes and then follow the stpes from staging them to commit.
